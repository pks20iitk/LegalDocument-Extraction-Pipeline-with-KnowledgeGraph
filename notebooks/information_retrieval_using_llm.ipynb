       "\"The loan is prepayable under certain circumstances and conditions. The conditions of prepayment are as follows:\\n\\n- Borrower may elect to prepay the Loan in full as set forth in Section 2.3.3; provided, that contemporaneously with such prepayment Borrower shall pay to Lender the Prepayment Premium, if any.\\n- If the Loan is accelerated for any reason, other than Casualty or Condemnation at a time that no Event of Default is continuing, Borrower shall pay to Lender, in addition to all other amounts outstanding under the Loan Documents, the Prepayment Premium that would be payable on the date of acceleration calculated as if Borrower had elected to make a voluntary prepayment of the Loan pursuant to Section 2.3.3.\\n- Borrower acknowledges that if payments of Principal are made to Lender on or prior to the Stated Maturity Date, for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary, as a result of Lender’s acceleration of the Loan after an Event of Default, by operation of law or otherwise, Lender will not receive all such interest and other benefits and may, in addition, incur costs. For these reasons, and to induce Lender to make the Loan, Borrower agrees to pay the Prepayment Premium.\\n\\nThe 'Exit Fee' is an additional fee that Borrower shall pay to Lender upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Stated Maturity Date, or (ii) the prepayment in full of the Loan. The amount of the Exit Fee depends on the date of prepayment and is as follows:\\n- If the Exit Fee Date occurs prior to the monthly Payment Date occurring in November, 2023, $0.00\\n- If the Exit Fee Date occurs on or after the monthly Payment Date occurring in November, 2023 and prior to the monthly Payment Date occurring in May, 2024, $34,544.50\\n- If the Exit Fee Date occurs on or after the monthly Payment Date occurring in May, 2024 and prior to the monthly Payment Date occurring in November, 2024, $69,089.00\\n- If the Exit Fee Date occurs on or after the monthly Payment Date occurring in November, 2024, $138,177.98\\n\\nThe 'Prepayment Premium' is an additional amount that Borrower shall pay to Lender upon prepayment of the Loan. The Prepayment Premium is calculated as the positive difference between $1,000,000.00 and the aggregate amount of all regularly-scheduled interest payments made at any time on or prior to the date of determination under the Loan Agreement. If the Prepayment Premium is less than zero, it will be deemed to be zero.\\n\\nThe conditions of prepayment under 'Optional Prepayments' of the loan agreement are as follows:\\n\\n- Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Principal in full (but not in part, except as expressly provided in Section 2.3.3, Section 2.8, Section 3.4.5, and Section 5.33), provided that (I) Borrower gives Lender at least thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof and (II) such prepayment is accompanied by all other amounts due hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, (a) the Prepayment Premium applicable thereto, if any, (b) the Exit Fee, if any, and (c) any accrued and unpaid Undrawn Commitment Fees. Except as expressly set forth herein, no partial prepayments of Principal are permitted.\""
