Borrower may elect to prepay the Loan in full as set forth in Section 2.3.3; provided, that contemporaneously with such prepayment Borrower shall pay to Lender the Prepayment Premium, if any. (2) Acceleration. If the Loan is accelerated for any reason, other than Casualty or Condemnation at a time that no Event of Default is continuing, Borrower shall pay to Lender, in addition to all other amounts outstanding under the Loan Documents, the Prepayment Premium that would be payable on the date of acceleration calculated as if Borrower had elected to make a voluntary prepayment of the Loan pursuant to Section 2.3.3.

In addition to the payments of principal and interest set forth above, on each applicable Payment Date, to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 3.3.3 hereof, Borrower shall pay to Lender the Initial CapEx Reserve Undrawn Commitment Fee (the \u201cUndrawn Commitment Fee\u201d).

In connection with any determination by Lender that the Loan shall bear interest at the Alternate Rate (and/or the implementation thereof), Lender shall have the right, but not any obligation, to make any Alternate Rate Conversion Conforming Changes from time to time as Lender determines, in its sole but good faith discretion, are necessary in connection with such conversion and/or the implementation thereof, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Documents, any amendments implementing such Alternate Rate Conversion Conforming Changes will become effective upon written notice from Lender to Borrower and without any further action or consent of Borrower.

Borrower shall pay Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt of such certificate (the date of such payment being the \u201cIncreased Cost Payment Date\u201d). (5) Failure or delay on the part of Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall not waive Lender\u2019s right to demand such compensation; provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate Lender under this Section 2.8 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date Lender notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of Lender\u2019s intention to claim compensation for such increased costs or reduction; provided further, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then such 180 day period will be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect.

CASH MANAGEMENT AND RESERVES 3.1 Grant of Security Interest; Application of Funds. 3.1.1 Borrower has granted to Lender, within the security agreement provisions of the Security Instrument, and hereby grants to Lender, a first lien and security interest in the Clearing Account, the Operating Account and the Lender Account (including all Subaccounts and Reserves) (collectively, the \u201cCash Management Accounts\u201d), together with the funds therein, any interest earned thereon and proceeds thereof, and Borrower hereby pledges the Cash Management Accounts (and the funds therein, any interest earned thereon and proceeds thereof) as collateral security for the payment of all Debt and the performance of all obligations. Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the Cash Management Accounts or the monies deposited therein or permit any Lien to attach thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC financing statements, except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto. Borrower, Lender and Deposit Bank shall enter into the Clearing Account Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date, which shall provide, in part, that (i) Lender shall have dominion and control over the Clearing Account at all times, (ii) prior to notice from Lender to Deposit Bank directing that all available funds be swept to the Lender Account, all available funds in the Clearing Account shall be swept by the Deposit Bank to Borrower\u2019s Operating Account, and (iii) upon notice from Lender to Deposit Bank directing that all available funds be swept to the Lender Account, all available funds in the Clearing Account shall be swept by the Deposit Bank on a daily basis to the Lender Account or such other account as Lender shall direct in its discretion. During the continuance of a Cash Management Period, Lender shall be so entitled to direct Deposit Bank to sweep all available amounts deposited into the Clearing Account without any further authorization, consent or direction from Borrower or any other Person. Borrower shall not establish any deposit account other than the Operating Account and Clearing Account without the prior written consent of Lender and delivery to Lender of a deposit account control agreement in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Lender. The Lender Account will be under the sole control and dominion of Lender, and Borrower shall have no right of withdrawal therefrom. This Agreement is, among other things, intended by the parties to be a security agreement for purposes of the UCC. As such, and in connection with the security grant contained in each security instrument, Lender is irrevocably authorized to file UCC financing statements naming the Borrower as debtor, to perfect the Lender\u2019s security interest in the collateral, in all jurisdictions in which Lender believes in its sole discretion that such filing is appropriate. If Lender believes that an \u201call-asset\u201d collateral description, as contemplated by Section 9-504(2) of the UCC, is appropriate, Lender is irrevocably authorized to use such a collateral description, whether in one or more separate filings or as part of the collateral description in a filing that particularly describes the collateral. Lender is irrevocably authorized to file such continuation statements and other"}, {"Page": 49, "content": "Sch. 6.3.5-44 KL3 3373582.5 similar documents as it determines, in its sole opinion, are appropriate to protect and perfect its rights. 3.2 Cash Management Arrangements. Borrower shall cause all Gross Revenues (including Gross Revenues in the nature of sums payable by electronic transfer or credit card) to be deposited directly into the Clearing Account, which at all times shall be subject to Lender\u2019s dominion and control as more fully described in the Clearing Account Agreement and this Agreement. Borrower shall deliver such additional documents, including but not limited to letters to any tenants, property managers or payment processors, directing that all payments of Gross Revenues shall be paid into the Clearing Account (and providing that such tenants or other parties shall modify such payment directions only pursuant to instructions from Lender), as Lender shall reasonably require to demonstrate that all Gross Revenues are and shall be paid into the Clearing Account; provided, however, that so long as a Management Agreement is in full force and effect in accordance with the terms hereof, Manager shall be permitted to collect Gross Revenues directly from tenants under Leases so long as such Gross Revenues are cleared by Manager directly into the Clearing Account. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, all Gross Revenues received by Borrower or Manager shall be deposited into the Clearing Account within two (2) Business Days of receipt. The direction to any tenant and each other remitter of Gross Revenues to deposit such Gross Revenues into the Clearing Account shall not be modified except by Lender (or with Lender\u2019s prior written consent). Lender will establish subaccounts of the Lender Account (each, a \u201cSubaccount\u201d) and each funded Reserve shall be held in a separate Subaccount. Borrower shall pay for all expenses of opening and maintaining all of the above accounts. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, Lender may, in its discretion, maintain the Lender Account (including any Subaccount thereof) on a ledger-entry basis rather than as a separate and identifiable account, and funds held in the Lender Account (including any Subaccount thereof) shall not constitute trust funds and may be held together with other monies held by Lender. 3.3 Reserves. Advances or disbursements of proceeds from each of the Reserves hereunder shall not be made more than once in any calendar month other than in the sole and absolute discretion of Lender (and thus, to the extent Borrower desires to draw upon multiple Reserves in any calendar month, Borrower shall submit such draw requests concurrently). Any advance or disbursement of proceeds from any Reserve hereunder made prior to or without the fulfillment by Borrower of all of the conditions precedent thereto, whether or not known to Lender, shall not constitute a waiver by Lender of the requirement that all conditions, including the unperformed conditions, shall be required with respect to all future advances or disbursements. Borrower agrees that, by its acceptance of any advance or disbursement of proceeds from any Reserve hereunder, it shall be bound in all respects by any disbursement request submitted on its behalf in connection therewith with the same force and effect as if Borrower had itself executed and submitted such request and whether or not such request is executed and/or submitted by an authorized Person. Borrower agrees that neither the insufficiency of the amount of, nor the unavailability of, the proceeds of any Reserve, is intended to, and shall not, constitute a limitation on the obligation of Borrower to pay any of the amounts which may be due with respect to payment of the costs intended to be covered thereby or which otherwise may be due in connection therewith under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. This Section 3.3 is solely for the benefit of Lender and Borrower and all conditions to the obligations of Lender to make advances or disbursements hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Lender and may be freely waived or reduced in whole or in part by Lender at any time if in its sole discretion it"}, {"Page": 50, "content": "Sch. 6.3.5-45 KL3 3373582.5 deems it advisable to do so, and no Person other than Borrower (provided, however, that all conditions have been satisfied) shall have standing to require Lender to make any such advances or disbursements or to be a beneficiary hereunder or of any such advances or disbursements to be made hereunder. Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, accelerate all or any portion of the amounts to be advanced or disbursed under this Section 3.3 without regard to Borrower\u2019s satisfaction of the conditions to its entitlement to such advances or disbursements and no Person dealing with Borrower or any other Person shall have standing to demand any different performance from Lender. During the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes Lender to make disbursements or advances hereunder directly to any third party to pay for the costs contemplated by the applicable Reserve or to satisfy any of the conditions hereof following Borrower\u2019s failure to do the same and all such direct advances shall satisfy pro tanto any obligations of Lender to Borrower hereunder regardless of the disposition thereof by such third party or other Person. The aforesaid authorizations shall (i) not prevent Borrower from paying any Person or from satisfying the conditions and obligations hereunder, out of its own funds, (ii) in no event be construed so as to relieve Borrower or others from their obligations to pay such Persons, or to satisfy such conditions and obligations and (iii) in no event obligate Lender to disburse any amounts for any such purposes (it being understood that during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall have the right to apply such amounts in any manner and for any purpose as Lender shall determine in its discretion). Any funds remaining in the Reserves after the Debt has been paid in full shall be promptly returned to Borrower. 3.3.1 Required Repairs. Borrower shall perform and complete each item of the repairs and environmental remedial work at the Property described on Schedule 3.3.1 hereto (the \u201cRequired Repairs\u201d) by August 2, 2022.

Lender will either (a) apply funds in the Tax and Insurance Reserve to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof and Section 7.1 hereof, provided that Borrower has promptly supplied Lender with notices of all Taxes and Insurance Premiums due and has not already paid the same directly, or (b) reimburse Borrower for such amounts upon presentation of evidence of payment; subject, however, to Borrower\u2019s right to contest Taxes in accordance with Section 5.2 hereof, or (c) in Lender\u2019s sole and absolute discretion, release such funds to Borrower or Manager for payment of such Taxes and Insurance Premiums due. In making any payment relating to Taxes and Insurance Premiums, Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale, forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If Lender determines in its reasonable judgment that the funds in the Tax and Insurance Reserve will be insufficient to pay (or in excess of) the Taxes or Insurance Premiums next coming due, Lender may increase (or decrease) the monthly contribution required to be made by Borrower to the Tax and Insurance Reserve. 3.3.3 Initial CapEx Reserve.

If Borrower is entitled to reimbursement out of the Proceeds or an Award held by Lender, such Proceeds or Award shall be disbursed from time to time from the Casualty/Condemnation Reserve upon Lender being furnished with (i) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender of the estimated cost of completion of the Restoration, (ii) a fixed price or guaranteed maximum cost construction contract for Restoration reasonably satisfactory to Lender, (iii) prior to the commencement of Restoration, all immediately available funds in addition to the Proceeds or Award that in Lender\u2019s reasonable judgment are required to complete the proposed Restoration shall be paid to Lender and deposited by Lender in the Casualty/Condemnation Reserve, (iv) such architect\u2019s certificates, waivers of lien, contractor\u2019s sworn statements, title insurance endorsements, bonds, plats of survey, permits, approvals, licenses and such other documents and items as Lender may reasonably require and approve in Lender\u2019s discretion, (v) all plans and specifications and construction contracts for such Restoration, such plans and specifications to be approved by Lender prior to commencement of any work (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (vi) if so required by Lender in its sole discretion, one-hundred percent (100%) performance and completion bonds from the general contractors or all major subcontractors and material suppliers. Lender may, at Borrower\u2019s expense, retain a consultant to review and approve all requests for disbursements, which approval shall also be a condition precedent to any disbursement. No payment made prior to the final completion of the Restoration shall exceed ninety percent (90%) of the value of the work performed from time to time; funds other than the Proceeds or Award shall be disbursed prior to disbursement of such Proceeds or Award; and at all times, the undisbursed balance of such Proceeds or Award remaining in the hands of Lender, together with funds deposited for that purpose or irrevocably committed to the satisfaction of Lender by or on behalf of Borrower for that purpose, shall be at least sufficient in the reasonable judgment of Lender to pay for the cost of completion of the Restoration, free and clear of all Liens or claims for Lien. Provided no Event of Default then exists, any surplus that remains out of the Proceeds held by Lender after payment of such costs of Restoration shall be paid to Borrower. Any surplus that remains out of the Award received by Lender after payment of such costs of Restoration shall, in the discretion of Lender, be retained by Lender and applied to payment of the Debt or returned to Borrower. 7.4.4 Prepayment upon Casualty or Condemnation.
