Do not summarize the bullet points and remember to include all the points as mentioned in the source context. Extract the exact context from the source context while answering the question\n\n- If the question ask for the name of the borrower or lender: do not check the first page of the document. Check from introduction page of the document after the table of contents.\n\n- For questions asking for interest rate of Spread, search the named entity Spread and find the interest rate, followed by any relation to other variables.\n\n- For questions related to interest rate, answer with the rate of Spread and the initial benchmark and how they are related. Use the proper terminology of initial benchmark as mentioned in the context.\n\n- For question related to initial benchmark, search the named entity Benchmark and find the initial benchmark term. The initial benchmark can be Term SOFR, LIBOR and various other entities.\n\n- For questions asking for initial maturity date or stated maturity date, search the named entity Stated Maturity Date and find the maturity date. The Stated Maturity Date should be an independent entity under definitions header.\n\n- For questions related to prepayability of loan, mention the numbers and facts like, Sections under which they are related. Do not summarize any response. Write only the answers.\n\n- For questions related to description of future advances, explain the Initial CapEx Reserve with facts and numbers. Mention the value of the Initial CapEx Reserve.\n\n- For question asking about the extension options, include the following terminologies in your answer and explain them to the context: First Extended Maturity Date, Second Extended Maturity Date, Extension Conditions. State all the details from the Extension Options subheading. Do not skip any detail and do not summarize any response.\n\nThe Contract is mentioned below between triple quotes and the Insight is mentioned between angle brackets.\n\nContract: '''{context}'''.\n\nThe below-mentioned Insight in angle brackets has been dug out from the above contract carefully, take this Insight and analyze the contract accordingly and output the chain of thought for how you would find this insight step by step from the given Contract.\n\nQuestion: <{question}>.\n\nHere are a few example questions and answers:\nQuestion: What is the closing date of the loan agreement?\nAnswer: <closing date> (the 'Closing Date')\n\nQuestion: What is the Stated Maturity Date of the loan in the agreement?\nAnswer: <stated maturity date>\n\nQuestion: \"What is the spread and the relation between the spread and the initial benchmark to calculate the interest rate? What is the proper term of the initial benchmark. What is the value of the index floor rate mentioned in the document?\"\nAnswer: The spread is <spread value> and the relationship with spread and the initial benchmark is <relationship with initial benchmark>. The initial benchmark term is <initial benchmark term>. The value of the index floor rate is <index floor rate>.\nIf you don't know the answer, return None, don't try to make up an answer.\nContext information is below.\n\n- Make sure you answer to the question is well formed and is correct.\n- Once you find the answer to the question, output a chain of thought for how you found the answer to the question.\n\nHere's a checklist for the chain of thought:\n- Mention all the steps in detail you took to find the answer to the question.\n- Explain each step you took thoroughly.\n- Make sure to mention all the steps separately.\n- If the question contains multiple things like spread, initial benchmark, index floor rate, etc. Then you need to mention multiple steps.\n- To make the users better understand your chain of thought, break down your chain of thought into multiple steps.\n- Break down your answer into multiple answers and mention steps you took to find that answer.\n\nYour output should only be a well-formatted JSON.\nYou can use the below JSON template to create your output.\nYour output should be an array of multiple objects.\n\nTemplate:\nEach step you took should be an object in an array and each object should contain the key-value pair mentioned below .\n\n- key: \"answer\", value: \"your correct answer to the given question\"\n\n- key: \"heading\", value: \"A heading for the steps you took to find the answer to the question\".\n\n- key: \"action\", value: \"what step you took to answer the question, mention them as a human, eg: I did this, or I did that\".\n\n- key: \"reason\", value: \"A detailed explanation for the steps you took to find the answer, for example: you searched for spread then you should explain how and where did you find the spread and what was the value of it\".\n\n\nHere's an example chain of thought:\n\n\"answer\": \"<Your well-thought answer to the question mentioned above>\",\n\"heading\": \"Finding the spread\",\n\"action\": \"<Action you took to find the spread>\",\n\"reason\": \"<Explanation for how were you able to find the spread and what was the value of it>\"\n,\n\"heading\": \"Finding the initial benchmark\",\n\"action\": \"<Action you took to find the initial benchmark>\",\n\"reason\": \"<Explanation for how and where you were able to find the initial benchmark>\"\n,\n\"heading\": \"Finding the index floor rate\",\n\"action\": \"<Action you took to find the index floor rate>\",\n\"reason\": \"<Explanation for how were you able to find the index floor rate>\"\n,\n\"heading\": \"Heading for your step\",\n\"action\": \"<Action you took>\",\n\"reason\": \"<Your Explanation>\".\n\nMake sure your output is detailed and explains through a chain of thought that how you found the answer to the given question.\n\nMake sure you explain all the actions as separate steps in your chain of thought with a briefly explained reason for that action.\n\nMake sure you output only the JSON.\n\nDouble-check your answer before finalizing it.\n\nMake sure your answer to the question is correct.\n\nYour response should only be the JSON output.\n\nDo not write any extra text outside the JSON object."
