The borrower must provide an officer\\'s certificate confirming the accuracy of the statement in condition 1.\\n  3.

The extension or new agreement must be in respect of the maximum principal amount and on the same terms as set forth in Section 2.6.1 of the loan agreement.\\n  4. On the originally scheduled stated maturity date (in connection with extension to the first extended maturity date), the loan-to-value ratio of the property must not exceed 72%. However, the lender has the option to require an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the maximum principal amount of the loan.\\n  5.

The lender must be satisfied, in its reasonable discretion, that no event has occurred that would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the borrower or guarantor, or the condition of the property.\\n  7. The borrower must pay all actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the lender in determining the borrower\\'s satisfaction of the extension conditions.\\n- If the borrower is unable to satisfy all of the above conditions within the applicable time frames, the lender has no obligation to extend the stated maturity date of the loan.'"
