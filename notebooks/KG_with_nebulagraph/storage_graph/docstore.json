Borrower acknowledges that (a) \nLender is making the Loan in consideration of the receipt by Lender of all interest and other \nbenefits intended to be conferred by the Loan Documents and (b) if payments of Principal are \nmade to Lender on or prior to the Stated Maturity Date, for any reason whatsoever, whether \nvoluntary, as a result of Lender\u2019s acceleration of the Loan after an Event of Default, by operation \nof law or otherwise, Lender will not receive all such interest and other benefits and may, in \naddition, incur costs. For these reasons, and to induce Lender to make the Loan, Borrower agrees \nthat, except as expressly provided in Section 2.3.2 hereof, Section 2.8 hereof and Article 7  hereof, \nall repayments and prepayments, if any, whether voluntary or involuntary, will be accompanied \nby the Prepayment Premium applicable thereto; provided, however , that the foregoing shall not be \ndeemed to imply that the Loan may be voluntarily prepaid in any manner or under any \ncircumstance other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Such Prepayment Premium shall \nbe required whether payment is made by Borrower, by a Person on behalf of Borrower, or by the \npurchaser at any foreclosure sale, and may be included in any bid by Lender at such sale. Borrower \nfurther acknowledges that (A) it is a knowledgeable real estate developer and/or investor; (B) it \nfully understands the effect of the provisions of this Section 2.7.3, as well as the other provisions \nof the Loan Documents; (C) the making of the Loan by Lender at the Interest Rate and other terms \nset forth in the Loan Documents are sufficient consideration for Borrower\u2019s obligation to pay a \nPrepayment Premium (if required); and (D) Lender would not make the Loan on the terms set forth \nherein without the inclusion of such provisions. Borrower also acknowledges that the provisions \nof this Agreement limiting the right of prepayment and providing for the payment of the \nPrepayment Premium and other charges specified herein were independently negotiated and \nbargained for, and constitute a specific material part of the consideration given by Borrower to \nLender for the making of the Loan except as expressly permitted hereunder.  Furthermore, \nBorrower hereby acknowledges that the Prepayment Premium constitutes liquidated damages to \ncompensate Lender for reinvestment costs, lost opportunity costs, and the loss by Lender of its \nbargained-for investment in the Loan.  Borrower agrees that such liquidated damages are not a \npenalty but are a reasonable estimate in good faith of the actual damages sustained by the holder \nhereof as a result of such prepayment, which actual damages are impossible to ascertain with \nprecision. \n2.7.4 Intentionally Omitted.\n2.7.5 Undrawn Commitment Fee.
